bbPress is forum software with a twist from the creators of WordPress

== Description ==

Have you ever been frustrated with forum or bulletin board software that was slow, bloated and always got your server hacked? bbPress is focused on ease of integration, ease of use, web standards, and speed.

We're keeping things as small and light as possible while still allowing for great add-on features through WordPress's extensive plugin system. What does all that mean? bbPress is lean, mean, and ready to take on any job you throw at it.

== Installation ==

1. Place the 'bbpress' folder in your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate bbPress.
3. Visit 'Settings > Forums' and adjust your configuration.
4. Create some forums.
5. View your site.
6. Adjust the CSS of your theme as needed, to make everything pretty.
